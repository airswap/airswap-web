# AirSwap Web

It's dangerous to go alone, take this!

- AirSwap is a decentralized network for trading digital assets: a novel design that protects traders from counterparty risk, price slippage, and front running.
- AirSwap is the weapon of choice for traditional market makers entering the decentralized financial system. With its focus on peer-to-peer, AirSwap is the de facto standard for RFQ (“request for quote”) and OTC (“over the counter”) style trading.
- AirSwap itself is an open project and community that collaborates on network development with participants earning protocol fees for their contributions.

AirSwap is the original token swapping app. Over the years, several iterations were launched, with the current version released two years ago. While it works well, the industry has evolved, technology has improved, and open source is now the default.

We propose to reintroduce AirSwap as a token swapping destination, refined around a lean, simple, and secure swapping experience establishing a new visual style for AirSwap web properties and being open source with many contributors.
