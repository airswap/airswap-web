Allow adding a border to an element by just adding a border-width.\n   *\n   *    By default, the way the browser specifies that an element should have no\n   *    border is by setting it's border-style to \\`none\\` in the user-agent\n   *    stylesheet.\n   *\n   *    In order to easily add borders to elements by just setting the \\`border-width\\`\n   *    property, we change the default border-style for all elements to \\`solid\\`, and\n   *    use border-width to hide them instead. This way our \\`border\\` utilities only\n   *    need to set the \\`border-width\\` property instead of the entire \\`border\\`\n   *    shorthand, making our border utilities much more straightforward to compose.\n   *\n   *    https://github.com/tailwindcss/tailwindcss/pull/116\n   */\n\n  *,\n  ::before,\n  ::after {\n    box-sizing: border-box; /* 1 */\n    border-width: 0; /* 2 */\n    border-style: solid; /* 2 */\n    border-color: #e5e7eb; /* 2 */\n  }\n\n  /*\n   * Ensure horizontal rules are visible by default\n   */\n\n  hr {\n    border-top-width: 1px;\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Undo the \\`border-style: none\\` reset that Normalize applies to images so that\n   * our \\`border-{width}\\` utilities have the expected effect.\n   *\n   * The Normalize reset is unnecessary for us since we default the border-width\n   * to 0 on all elements.\n   *\n   * https://github.com/tailwindcss/tailwindcss/issues/362\n   */\n\n  img {\n    border-style: solid;\n  }\n\n  textarea {\n    resize: vertical;\n  }\n\n  input::placeholder,\n  textarea::placeholder {\n    opacity: 1;\n    color: #9ca3af;\n  }\n\n  button,\n  [role=\"button\"] {\n    cursor: pointer;\n  }\n\n  table {\n    border-collapse: collapse;\n  }\n\n  h1,\n  h2,\n  h3,\n  h4,\n  h5,\n  h6 {\n    font-size: inherit;\n    font-weight: inherit;\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Reset links to optimize for opt-in styling instead of\n   * opt-out.\n   */\n\n  a {\n    color: inherit;\n    text-decoration: inherit;\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Reset form element properties that are easy to forget to\n   * style explicitly so you don't inadvertently introduce\n   * styles that deviate from your design system.
